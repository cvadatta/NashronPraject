#Nashron Project



* My First repository in Git Hub,

* First Use of Nashron direct calling and with invokable functions.

* Used Bindings,and called functions from JS to Java and Vice-Versa(IntegerScripit.java).

* Passing JSON Object from Java to JS and vice-versa(JsonTest.java and ReturnTask.java).

* Calculated the time for calling a programm from only java and from both Java and JS with NASHRON seperatley for 1000 times and took average of it and the same procedure is repeated for 5 times and took the final averageof it and calculated the time difference between them,which resulted a difference of "0.54"Milli seconds(TimeCalculation.Java and TimeCalulationwithonlyJava).

* API call from JS {used fetch API}(FetchApi.Java).
